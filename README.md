#task tracker that will move through the process of your tasks

For this assignment, I made sure to finalize a site that met the criteria of the stakeholder by updating the HTML to accomodate a modal. I also worked javascript files to be able to handle the input on the modal, storing information on previously added tasks. I utilized css to make the cards within the swimlanes to give a visual represenation of when tasks are due. 



GIVEN a task board to manage a project
WHEN I open the task board
THEN the list of project tasks is displayed in columns representing the task progress state (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed)✅
WHEN I view the task board for the project
THEN each task is color coded to indicate whether it is nearing the deadline (yellow) or is overdue (red)✅
WHEN I click on the button to define a new task
THEN I can enter the title, description and deadline date for the new task into a modal dialog✅
WHEN I click the save button for that task
THEN the properties for that task are saved in localStorage✅
WHEN I drag a task to a different progress column
THEN the task's progress state is updated accordingly and will stay in the new column after refreshing✅
WHEN I click the delete button for a task
THEN the task is removed from the task board and will not be added back after refreshing✅
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved tasks persist✅
