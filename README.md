#task tracker that will move through the process of your tasks

For this assignment, I made sure to finalize a site that met the criteria of the stakeholder by updating the HTML to accomodate a modal. I also worked javascript files to be able to handle the input on the modal, storing information on previously added tasks. I utilized css to make the cards within the swimlanes to give a visual represenation of when tasks are due.
